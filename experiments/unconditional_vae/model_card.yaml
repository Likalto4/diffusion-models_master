This model is a latent diffusion model for unconditional image generation of mammograms of size 512vs512.
The model was trained with 1000 images using the [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) architecture.
The model was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 8 and gradient accumulation of 4, using around 9 GB of GPU memory. 

## Usage

```python
from diffusers import DDPMPipeline

pipeline = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained({hub_model_id})
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
