This is a latent diffusion model for generation of mammograms with size 64x64 in the latent space.
It was trained with 4K images in the latent space (10% of the original dataset) for 50 epochs.
Images in the latent space have size (4,64,64) and can generate images of 512x512 when decoded using the VAE. 

## Usage

```python
from diffusers import DDPMPipeline

pipeline = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained({hub_model_id})
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
